    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Next week we will finish our discussion about the Private Language Argument. After that, we will move on to talk about Hare&#8217;s <em>The Language of Morals</em>. I will specify the relevant sections in the next day or two. In the meantime, I wanted to give you some suggestions for how to prepare for our next meeting.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>Remember that we were considering two different candidates for the conclusion of the Private Language Argument. Wittgenstein is arguing against the possibility of a language in which &#8220;The individual words <span>&#8230;</span> are to refer to what can only be known to the person speaking; to his immediate private sensations&#8221; (&#167;243). But this can be interpreted in one of two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Words (or expressions) cannot refer to these &#8216;private sensations&#8217;.</li>

<li>No word can be such that its meaning is exhausted by the &#8216;private sensations&#8217; it refers to.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please think about the following two questions. Your answers to these will form the basis for our discussion next Monday.</p>

<ul>
<li>Can we argue from (1) to the conclusion that <em>there are no</em> private sensations?</li>

<li>What reasons does Wittgenstein provide for thinking that (2) is true? Do they also support the claim that (1) is true?</li>
</ul>

<p>In thinking about these questions, you should grant Wittgenstein the following claim.<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>For a word to have meaning, there must be publicly available standards to determine when utterances of sentences involving are correct.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. And remember that I hold office hours on Mondays from 1-3.</p>
<div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'>
<p>See the section titled &#8216;Wittgenstein on Meaning, Understanding, and Following a Rule&#8217; in Soames, <em>Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century</em>, Vol. 2 for discussion of this thesis in the context of the discussion of the rule-following considerations.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following up on the discussion today about Physicalism, I thought I&#8217;d point you to a paper that does a nice job at spelling out what the possible views are:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>David Chalmers, &#8220;Consciousness and its place in Nature&#8221;. Reprinted in: Chalmers, D. (ed.), <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Mind-Classical-Contemporary-Readings/dp/019514581X'><em>Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings</em></a>, New York: OUP, 2002.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See in particular the section entitled &#8216;Type B Materialism&#8217;. (I&#8217;ve posted an electronic version of the paper in the <a href='http://db.tt/IreiS75o'>Dropbox</a> folder.)</p>]]></content>
