    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Next week we will finish our discussion about the Private Language Argument. After that, we will move on to talk about Hare’s <em>The Language of Morals</em>. I will specify the relevant sections in the next day or two. In the meantime, I wanted to give you some suggestions for how to prepare for our next meeting. </p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Remember that we were considering two different candidates for the conclusion of the Private Language Argument. Wittgenstein is arguing against the possibility of a language in which “The individual words […] are to refer to what can only be known to the person speaking; to his immediate private sensations” (§243). But this can be interpreted in one of two ways: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Words (or expressions) cannot refer to these ‘private sensations’.</li>
  <li>No word can be such that its meaning is exhausted by the ‘private sensations’ it refers to. </li>
</ol>

<p>Please think about the following two questions. Your answers to these will form the basis for our discussion next Monday.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can we argue from (1) to the conclusion that <em>there are no</em> private sensations?</li>
  <li>What reasons does Wittgenstein provide for thinking that (2) is true? Do they also support the claim that (1) is true? </li>
</ul>

<p>In thinking about these questions, you should grant Wittgenstein the following claim:<sup id="fnref:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For a word to have meaning, there must be publicly available standards to determine when utterances of sentences involving are correct.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. And remember that I hold office hours on Mondays from 1-3. </p>

      <p>See the section titled ‘Wittgenstein on Meaning, Understanding, and Following a Rule’ in Soames, <em>Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century</em>, Vol. 2 for discussion of this thesis in the context of the discussion of the rule-following considerations.<a href="#fnref:fn1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following up on the discussion today about Physicalism, I thought I’d point you to a paper that does a nice job at spelling out what the possible views are: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>David Chalmers, “Consciousness and its place in Nature”. Reprinted in: Chalmers, D. (ed.), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Mind-Classical-Contemporary-Readings/dp/019514581X"><em>Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings</em></a>, New York: OUP, 2002. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>See in particular the section entitled ‘Type B Materialism’. (I’ve posted an electronic version of the paper in the <a href="http://db.tt/IreiS75o">Dropbox</a> folder.)</p>
